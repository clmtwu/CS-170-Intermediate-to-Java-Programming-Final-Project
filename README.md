Authors: Clement Wu, Hengjin Mao, Eric Huang
Language: Java, maybe HTML for GUI

Final Project:

Directions:
Use GUI, graphics, colors, sounds, animations or images, event handling, exception handling, Layout 
managers, file I/O and other techniques in Java to develop alphabet-learning program as an educational 
and attractive game for pre-school or first grade kids.  The game should be interactive, colorful with sounds, 
fun to play for kids and able to display player’s scores. A file will store the top 5 player’s names and scores, 
and be displayed when a button is pressed in your game window.  Documentation requirements are the same as in your labs.
